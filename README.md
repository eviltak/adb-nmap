# adb-nmap
An ADB network device discovery and connection library with a CLI

## Why adb-nmap
adb-nmap looks for ADB-supported devices on a network and optionally connects the ADB server to them. This is much easier than having to look up the device's local network address and using the `adb connect` command, especially when done through an IDE.
